# portfolio
Build of my first portfolio to describe myself and my works 

Here is my portfolio's code.

If you are a recruiter you can inspect it in details or not and contact me or not then.

If you are a dev that intend to start your own portfolio, you can pick some ideas or the entire project (don't forget to change the name and contact, it could help for your job researches)

Whoever you are, feel free to contact me for any feelback, advices, or suggestions.

Have a nice time reading this
